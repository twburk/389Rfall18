*In this scenario I believe that you should tell everyone, your boss, consumer watchdog, and the public. The order I would approach this at is boss first, public second, and the consumer watchdog third. I believe this is the correct order because by telling your boss first you will be able to get started on developing a solution to this problem as soon as possible, you will also have to ensure the authority above you is well inform of what is happening. The public should be told in this case because their lives are in danger. Some may argue this saying that people will be notified of vulnerabilities and try and infiltrate the systems, but I would argue back that there could be blood on your hands if you don’t inform people of the risk. Finally, in this case the consumer watchdog should be told just to keep them informed. If the company is unwilling to postpone the release, I would have to go to the public myself to let the people know the risk of this ECU. In this certain scenario people’s physical lives could be in danger, and we shouldn’t try to hide this information from them. Additionally, if I choose to do nothing even though I knew of the security problems, and harm was done to someone I should 100 percent be held responsible. It should by my duty to inform people in order to prevent harm from happening. If I done nothing to stop it, it shows that I am okay with this happening and that I wanted this to happen. As a employee you should want the product to be usable, and safe and you shouldn’t stop at anything to inform people when there is flaws in the system that could lead to harm. *
